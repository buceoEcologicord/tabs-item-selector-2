Devnotes Item-selector-grid-2 

tabs:
- Tabs prefabs must have buttons or toggle (The selected color change is pulled from button.colors or toggle.colors)

To use toggle groups:
Add toggle group in Section prefab 

Sections:
- Headers or division objects: add as a Game Object of Section Prefab to separate sections wit headers or lines

Next steps:
- Add sprites/images or other GO to items
- Test if works with tabs as toggles or images
- Add toggle functionality to tabs (similar to buttons)
- Add capability for item button/toggle funcionality
- Decouple using IItem and ICategory interfaces that:
   -- can be implemented into different types of Item data management or category management (taking assets or abstract clases or public structs, etc)
   -- Can be implemented in the current item and category SO
