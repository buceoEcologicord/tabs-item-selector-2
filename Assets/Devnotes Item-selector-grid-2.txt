tabs:
- Tabs prefabs must have buttons or toggle (The selected color change is pulled from button.colors or toggle.colors)
- Advanced: make tabs toggles to "filter" items by categories

To use toggle groups:
Add toggle group in Section prefab 

Sections:
- Headers or division objects: add as a Game Object of Section Prefab to separate sections wit headers or lines

Items:
- Items prefabs must have button or toggle component 
- Add ItemBuilder component to Item prefab and assign references
- Configure selected item color/Image from the prefab: You can use button/Toggle transition colors or image swap to show selected/unselected state
  -- For color change when selected: Assign the item prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the color transition in the button/toggle options
     -- For Toggles you can add another GaemObject with Image component as background to change color when selected, define the color on this Image component
  -- For Image Swap when selected: 
      --- Assign the item prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the Sprite swap transition in the button/toggle options
      --- Modify Item Script to add a second Sprite reference for selected state and assign it in the ItemBuilder component
      --- Modify the ItemBuilder.LoadItemPrefab to assign the corresponding images for normal and selected states for button or toggle components
- To add more than one label, icon, button or toggle for each item Example: add price label, rarity icon, more info button, etc: 
    -- Extend ItemBuilder script with multiple label/icon references
    -- Modify AssignItemIcons or AssignItemLabels methods. 
- To add click events to items, add listeners to ItemBuilder.onClick event. 
  -- You can use ItemBuilder HandleClick, SetButtonActions or SetToggleActions methods to modify behavior of button/toggle components

Next steps:
- Add sprites/images or other GO to items (Script ItemLoader as API)
- Add tab color logic
- Test if works with tabs as toggles or images
- Add toggle functionality to tabs (similar to buttons)
- Decouple using IItem and ICategory interfaces that:
   -- can be implemented into different types of Item data management or category management (taking assets or abstract clases or public structs, etc)
   -- Can be implemented in the current item and category SO
- Make tabs toggles to filter items by categories (no need for ToggleGroup since I could just creat a new tab Scroll View?)
