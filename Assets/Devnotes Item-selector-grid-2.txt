Devnotes Item-selector-grid-2 

-------------------------------
Setup instructions:

Running the code:

- To launch the UI Call public method TabsItemSelectorManager.CreateTabsItemSelector()

tabs:
- Tabs prefabs must have buttons (upcoming functionality: or toggle to filter) (The selected color change is pulled from button.colors or toggle.colors)
- Add TabBuilder component to Tab prefab and assign references
- Configure selected tab color/Image from the prefab: You can use button/Toggle transition colors or image swap to show selected/unselected state
  -- For color change when selected: Assign the tab prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the color transition in the button/toggle options
     -- For Toggles you can add another GaemObject with Image component as background to change color when selected, define the color on this Image component
  -- For Image Swap when selected: 
      --- Assign the tab prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the Sprite swap transition in the button/toggle options
      --- Modify Tab Script to add a second Sprite reference for selected state and assign it in the TabBuilder component
      --- Modify the TabBuilder.LoadTabPrefab to assign the corresponding images for normal and selected states for button or toggle components
- Tip: when setting toggles/buttons make sure the color and alpha is the same for the image color, normal, selected and pressed colors to avoid flickering when switching between active categories


To use toggle groups:
Add toggle group in Section prefab 

Sections:
- Headers or division objects: add as a Game Object of Section Prefab to separate sections wit headers or lines

Items:
- Items prefabs must have button or toggle component 
- Add ItemBuilder component to Item prefab and assign references
- Configure selected item color/Image from the prefab: You can use button/Toggle transition colors or image swap to show selected/unselected state
  -- For color change when selected: Assign the item prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the color transition in the button/toggle options
     -- For Toggles you can add another GaemObject with Image component as background to change color when selected, define the color on this Image component
  -- For Image Swap when selected: 
      --- Assign the item prefab icon gameObject with an Image component to toggle/button target graphics and choose the Sprite swap transition in the button/toggle options
      --- Modify Item Script to add a second Sprite reference for selected state and assign it in the ItemBuilder component
      --- Modify the ItemBuilder.LoadItemPrefab to assign the corresponding images for normal and selected states for button or toggle components
- To add more than one label, icon, button or toggle for each item Example: add price label, rarity icon, more info button, etc: 
    -- Extend ItemBuilder script with multiple label/icon references
    -- Modify AssignItemIcons or AssignItemLabels methods. 
- To add click events to items, add listeners to ItemBuilder.onClick event. 
  -- You can use ItemBuilder HandleClick, SetButtonActions or SetToggleActions methods to modify behavior of button/toggle components

Adjustments instructions:
TabManager:
- ForceColors to set button/toggle colors on tabs directly from TabManager settings
- TabChangeTolerance: To adjust how far from the top a category is consider to be active

Next steps:
- Update tab visuals also when sections scroll horizontally (currently only updates when scrolling vertically)


- Add tab color logic
- Test if works with tabs as toggles
- Add toggle functionality to tabs (similar to buttons)
- Decouple using IItem and ICategory interfaces that:
   -- can be implemented into different types of Item data management or category management (taking assets or abstract clases or public structs, etc)
   -- Can be implemented in the current item and category SO
- Make tabs toggles to filter items by categories (no need for ToggleGroup since I could just creat a new tab Scroll View?)
-  Pending to add functionality for GridLayout without sections separating in different lines to allow a continuous grid of items without missing spaces in some lines
